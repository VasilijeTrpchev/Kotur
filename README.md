# Kotur - Cafe
As a member of the frontend team in the Online Hackathon organized by Brainster, I had a great experience collaborating with skilled colleagues. Kotur - Cafe is a dynamic website designed for a real café, allowing customers to:

Find and reserve tables

Explore the food, drinks, and cocktail menus

Get information about upcoming films and festivals

Purchase tickets for events

The platform aims to enhance the café's customer engagement by offering a seamless digital experience.
